# R Flutter

A Flutter implementation of the soundboard R.app. 

The latest builds for Windows, macOS and Linux (Wayland) can be found in the Release section :)

For macOS, it may be blocked by the Gatekeeper, and it will say the `R Collection.app` is damaged and should be deleted...

For that I use this command `xattr -c path/to/R\ Collection.app` to move it out of quarantine.
